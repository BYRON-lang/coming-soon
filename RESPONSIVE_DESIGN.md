# Gridrr - Responsive Design Implementation

This document outlines the responsive design implementation for the Gridrr website, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across various devices and screen sizes.

## Overview

The Gridrr website has been designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless experience across all device sizes. The implementation uses modern CSS techniques, including:

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first responsive design
- **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layouts
- **Viewport units** for scalable typography and spacing
- **Media queries** for device-specific adjustments
- **Responsive images** with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes

## Breakpoints

The following breakpoints are used throughout the application:

| Breakpoint | Prefix | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 320px      | `xs:`  | Extra small devices (portrait phones) |
| 480px      | `sm:`  | Small devices (landscape phones) |
| 768px      | `md:`  | Medium devices (tablets) |
| 1024px     | `lg:`  | Large devices (desktops) |
